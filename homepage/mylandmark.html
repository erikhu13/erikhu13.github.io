<h1>My Home - Carl Schurz</h1>
<p>
Carl Schurz. First the Roller Hockey. Then the slides and swings. Then the soccer and the sprinklers. The park never failed me when I wanted something to do with my friends, neither did it fail me when I was in a bad mood and needed some time outside. It has been there for me my whole life, always turning any frown upside down when needed. The beauty of the park is still there, just recognized differently now.
When others visit this landmark, they see an uncrowded park, with theiryour time and space to themselvesyourself. I see it all in my head, like a map of the park in bird’s eye view that is supposed to be memorized. I see the dog parks vividly in my head before getting close to them, the big one and the one for the non-energetic, small dogs. I know I am next to the park once iIt starts to smell like the ice cream truck along with the fresh river scent.
Many use this park to hang out with friends, run, or walk their dogs. I use it simply to admire and experience rejuvenation as it always feels nostalgic walking through the same checkered paths that I vividly remember running through a decade ago. Carl Schurz park is different from the typical parks because on one side it can smell like dog poop while on the other side it smells like fresh water and you can feel the breeze, while you breathe what feels like piercing air, as you walk along the promenade. While for others the park may serve as a pitstop before the next thing on their schedule, for me it serves as the five5 star hotel Iyou never knew Iyou needed. It’s like playing a sport:, Iyou forget about all the current problems and causes of stress in life and just relax. The park always refreshes my mood when needed, similar to how you wake up after a night of sleep, energized for whatever is next.
Renovations are often thought of as an advancement and an admirable piece of work. You would think a little upgrade never hurt anyone, but I think renovations can sometimes strip away a part of you, like losing a photograph or a teddy bear you’ve had your entire childhood. Us Upper East Siders truly show the park love, either by simply using the park regularly, or by loving it more and cleaning up whoever’s trash they see. The appreciation of the park by the community is clear. It has always been maintained solely by the park lovers and civilians. Avoiding renovation is a must, it would be a threat to the community. Everyday you can see the subtle help of the park, anything that can help keep the park original.
Central park is nothing special, bigger than a whole neighborhood, half of the people not being loyal to the park, and people treating the grass as a convenient trash can. I don’t recognize the physical features of an important place, but rather the emotions it brings me. What I mean when I say Carl Schurz is not the park itself, but the certain vibe everyone knows it gives. The ‘what would I do without Schurz’ gives off the more accurate feeling of this park which no other park has done for me.
As you grow older, sometimes simply recognizing something that’s been with you forever makes you appreciate it simply for growing with you. While this place hasn’t changed physically at all since as young as I remember, I do think about it differently. Before I used the park as a place to have fun, and now I recognize the beauty of its never changing features. It’s almost as if it feels more lonely now, as I focus on the park itself rather than the people it hosts every day.
